The Summarize CLI is a Node.js command-line tool designed to generate concise summaries of text files using AI models like Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT. 
Users can simply run a command such as "npx summarize ./article.txt" to automatically summarize the given file. 
The tool first checks whether the user has a Gemini API key stored in their system environment variables. 
If it finds one, it uses the Gemini API to process and summarize the file. 
If no Gemini key is found, it checks for an OpenAI API key and uses that instead.

In cases where neither key is available, the CLI provides an easy setup command: "npx summarize --setup". 
This setup flow allows users to choose between Gemini or OpenAI, input their API key, and automatically save it for future use. 
The tool then instructs the user to restart the terminal so the environment variables can take effect.

The goal of the Summarize CLI project is to simplify the process of summarizing text documents without requiring users to manually call APIs or write code. 
Itâ€™s especially useful for developers, students, and researchers who need quick summaries of long articles or documentation files directly from the terminal.
